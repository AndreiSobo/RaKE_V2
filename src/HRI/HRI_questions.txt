Prompts
1.	pickup object at 3,0,9 and return to origin
2.	pickup object that is 7 cm to the left and 4 cm forward of origin
3.	pickup the object situated 2 cm to the right from origin and move it at coordinates (-2,0,2)
4.	place the object at 4,0,1 two cm forward on the ground
5.	move the arm 2 cm to the left from origin. pickup the object situated on the ground 3 cm to the right from  your position and place it at position 5,0,5. do not return to origin
6.	move the object situated 2 cm to the left from origin to origin
7.	Pickup last object placed and place it on the ground 2 cm to the left. do not return to origin
8.	place the object situated at 2,1,2 on the ground 4 cm to the left
9.	Take the object at 1,0,1 and place it at 2,0,1. Then take another object at 3,0,3 and place it one cm to the right.
10. Take one object situated at 4,0,2 and place it on top of the object situated at cords -2,0,3
11. Move an object from -2,0,2 at coordinates 3,0,2. Then pick it up and move it 2 cm to the left
12. Pickup the object 4 cm to the left and drop it from 1 cm height to the coordinates 4,3,2
13.	From origin, draw a square in the air with a side length of 3.
14. There are 3 objects. First is  at coordinates 3,0,1, second is at 4,0,2 and third at -2,0,2. I want you to pick them and place them on top of each other at coordinates -5,0,5. The gripper can only hold one object at a time.
15. There are 2 objects are coordinates 3,0,2 and -3,0,2. Can you swap them around
16. Pickup the last two objects moved and place them next to each other at coords -5,0,7
17. Move the objects are coordinates (1,0,1) and (-2,0,1) to a new position where they will be placed at (5,0,5) and (6,0,5)
18. pickup the object at (1,0,1) and move it to a new Z position at (1,0,5)
19. pick up the object at coordinates (0,0,0) and move it to a new X position of 4 cm.
20. pick up the object at coordinates (3,0,1) and move it to a new Y position to coordinates (-2,1,-2)
